# mbnwc
Mount and Blade Open World mod set in Napoleonic Wars. Name: "New World Conflict".
This is the Module System (a m&b related structure), containing the python code needed for this Mod.
It does not contain models, maps and other resources.

#Building instructions
Before you build the module, don't forget to create a folder named "New World Conflict" besides the folder, where these files are included. Otherwise there will be errors. 
Then build the project through executing (double click on) build_module.bat. Your above created folder "New World Conflict" should now contain the "compiled" files.
